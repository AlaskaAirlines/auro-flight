# User story

As a designer, I want to be able to have access to a symbolized version, so I can easily reuse with my project.

## Outline subtasks or tasks

> List specific steps required to deliver this work.

- [ ] Add completed work to UI Kit as Sketch Symbol

## Definition of “Done” (exit criteria)

> The story is generally “done” when the user can complete the outlined task, but make sure to define what that is.

- [ ] the documented design spec has been created
- [ ] assets have been symbolized in the UI toolkit
- [ ] new UI has been applied to the WC
