## Change of Gauge

[Change of Gauge flights](https://www.travelweekly.com/Mark-Pestronk/Agents-must-identify-change-of-gauge-services) are flights with the same flight number, but with an equipment swap at a intermediate stop.

<auro-alerts information>Change of Gauge flights are a pain point for guests with physical disabilities whom may not expect to need to depart the aircraft. Even with the physical change of planes, these flights are still considered Direct. Qantas runs a COG JFK-SYD.</auro-alerts>

The following illustrates change of gauge flight, from SEA to SJD.

See [documentation](https://auro.alaskaair.com/components/auro/flightline/api) for additional information regarding the `<auro-flight-segment>` API.
